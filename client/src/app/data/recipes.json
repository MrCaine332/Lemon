    "description": "We're using apple juice and whiskey to produce one of my favorite versions of pulled pork. Which, by the way, we're not pulling it, it's more like smashing. Speaking of smash, the name comes from the fact that this was originally made with Jack Daniels®, but you can use any whiskey you want, like I did, or not at all. This is served with a very mustardy and acidic slaw specifically made to pair with the sweet pork.",
